In PostgreSQL, the ORDER BY keyword is used in a SELECT statement to sort the result set based on one or more columns. 
It allows you to specify the order in which the rows should be returned.



-- Sorting by a single column in ascending order
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary ASC;

-- Sorting by a single column in descending order
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;


ASC --- ASCENDING
DESC --- DESCENDING

SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY first_name;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY last_name;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY gender;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY id;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY email;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY country_of_birth;

SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY id, email;

SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY first_name DESC;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY last_name DESC;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY gender DESC;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
