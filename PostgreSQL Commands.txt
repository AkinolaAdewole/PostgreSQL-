PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system. 

Below are some essential PostgreSQL commands:

1.
psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -h <host> -p <port>
OR 
\c <database_name>


2. Creating a new database:
CREATE DATABASE database_name;

3.Dropping a database
   DROP DATABASE database_name;

4. Select all data from database:
   SELECT * FROM <database>;

5. Selecting first_name from a table:
    SELECT first_name FROM <name of table>;

6. select email from table:
   SELECT email FROM <name of table>;



In PostgreSQL, the ORDER BY keyword is used in a SELECT statement to sort the result set based on one or more columns. 
It allows you to specify the order in which the rows should be returned.

-- Sorting by a single column in ascending order
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary ASC;


SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY first_name;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY last_name;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY gender;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY country_of_birth;

ASC --- ASCENDING
DESC --- DESCENDING

SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY first_name DESC;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY last_name DESC;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY gender DESC;
SELECT * FROM <name of table> ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
